We use Loyalty smart contract to keep track of points earned and redeem by a member of the Synergy Loyalty program. Besides, we hold for each Member a score on how loyal he or she is.  It's designed to be upgradeable to support future features. 

## Getting started

### Development steps

```
# Install package
$ npm install

# Start the Ethereum emulator
$ npx ganache-cli --gasPrice 0 -l 100000000 -m "candy maple cake sugar pudding cream honey rich smooth crumble sweet treat"

# Then open a new terminal, first run the contracts migrations
$ px truffle migrate

# Last, run all the tests
$ npx truffle test
```

### Go to production 

```

# Update your settings on truffle-config.js according your prouduction enviroment. e.g., mine was: 
# 
#    production: {
#      host: "localhost",
#      port: 22000, // was 8545
#      network_id: "*", // Match any network id
#      gasPrice: 0,
#      // gas: 10000000,
#      type: "quorum" // needed for Truffle to support Quorum
#    }

$ npx truffle migrate --network production

# Now, you can run tests into the production

$ npx truffle test --network production
```
